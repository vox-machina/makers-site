    <h1>The Makers</h1>

    <p>
    We are making a project together.
    </p>

    The makers are:
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://elmo.voxmachina.org">ella</a></li>
    <li>will</li>
    <li>ross</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Click on one of the names to see what that person has been up to. <p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>

    <p>We are making a digital pet called Goofagotchi. Originally this was going to be a guinea pig called Goof the guinea pheonix, but we will start by just displaying a face on the screen as it is easier. He will sit in the middle of our table so we can all access him.He will need feeding every day and watering.</p>
